//reusable prompt data

for extra context{
	all the following prompts will be about coding in unity2018
	i will be reffering to algorithm with algo, component with compo, random number with rando

}


// temporary prompt data

for extra context{
	for the next prompts the idea is to create a powerup that when the player (a gameobject with a tag player) is in range it heals the player. but it only lasts a certain amount of time
}
consider{
	it only despawns when its lifespan is over
	it will add health to the player every 0.2 seconds provided its in range
	its health to add is set to healingamount * healing multiplier (adjustable)
}
